### Level up your code

There are two ways to write code. You can do it this way:
The International Obfuscated C Code Contest (https://www.ioccc.org/)
e.g.
https://www.ioccc.org/2020/ferguson2/prog.c
https://www.ioccc.org/2020/tsoj/prog.c
https://www.ioccc.org/2020/endoh3/prog.c

Or you can do it the opposite way:

Steve McConnell. Code Complete
https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670

Robert C. Martin. Clean Code
https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=0132350882&psc=1
